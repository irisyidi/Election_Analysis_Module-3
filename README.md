By creating the automation process through python, the code can be used to the elections where the total votes, the number of votes received by each candidates anad the related percentage of support are suppposed to be calculated in the process. The common examples of the situation when the script can be used are congressional districts and senatorial districts and local elections. 

Example 1: local elections
